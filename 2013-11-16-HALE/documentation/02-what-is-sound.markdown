## What is sound?

The simplest definition of sound is that it is a *pressure wave*.  To try to understand this, think about someone playing a guitar.  When they pluck a string it vibrates back and forth very quickly.  This vibration is transmitted through the air and eventually reaches your ear.  The wave causes your ear-drum to vibrate, and these vibrations are converted to electrical signals which your brain interprets as sound.

### Parts of a sound wave

To try to understand this more fully let's look at the simplest type of wave, called a *sine wave*.

Sine waves have two important elements to them:

- Frequency - How close together the peaks of the wave are.  If they are close together the sound is high-pitched (like a whistle).  If they are far apart the sound is low-pitched (like a rumble of thunder).
- Amplitude - How high the peaks of the wave are.  If they are large the sound is loud.  If they are small the sound is quiet.
